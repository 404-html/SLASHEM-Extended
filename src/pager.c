	"You are less sexy than you used to be and lost 10 points of charisma.",
	"You read yet another stupid message, and the effect of this particular one is like being sucked by a mind flayer's tentacles. As a result, you lost 3 points of intelligence.",
	"The image of the weeping angel appears in your mind! You lose Wisdom!",
	"The weeping angel is zapping wand of digging!",
	"The weeping angel is zapping wand of digging! Deutsches Sprach schweres Sprach!",

	"You are permanently interlocked with the weeping angel!",
	"WARNING: you have been contaminated by the image of the weeping angel! Read a scroll of remove curse or pray on a coaligned altar within 5000 turns, or you automatically die!",

	"No matter how exhausted you are, you may never rest again.",
	"Your sexiness fades... wait, were you ever sexy to begin with?",
	"Your consciousness fades... that's what playing this NetHack variant will do to you. (Don't you love AmyBSOD? :D)",
	"There is a trophy hall where all the skin shreds that were scraped off your shins by female high-heeled shoes are kept as exhibitions!",
	"Do you like high heels?",
	"Would you like it to get your legs scratched up and down by a pair of female high heels?",
	"Did you ever wonder why there are only female high heels, and no male ones?",
	"In the equality world, all women have to wear high heels at all times, and all men are forced to wear flats.",
	"On dungeon level 20, a toilet has been built specifically for you! If you sit on it while satiated, you will acquire intrinsic slow digestion!",

	"Vote now for more fleecy-colored traps in SLEX!",
	"If Amy didn't budge on the transvestite role, and some may say it was considerably controversial, you can't really see her budging on much of anything. And that's a good thing, because otherwise SLEX would deteriorate into yet another boring casual game.",
	"Are you annoyed by certain features in this beautiful game? You can tell Amy about it, but don't expect her to actually change the things in question. She will only do so if she personally feels they ought to be changed.",
	"Polling users to find out what they want to have removed from the game? Uhh, no. That won't happen in SLASH'EM Extended, due to Amy's policy of not removing things.",
	"Being a social justice warrior and trying to get Amy to remove parts of the game that you dislike will not work. She's the Iron Lady of SLASH'EM Extended, and has never gave in to such requests in the past. So better don't expect her to do so now!",
	"Do you hate the interface screw traps of this game? Chances are that the answer is yes, and you're free to have that opinion of course. Unfortunately for you, they are a part of the game though and will not get removed no matter what. Accept their existence and enjoy the game. :-)",

	"You feel like you just turned into Amy!",
	"Pondering why you are running around in a dungeon looking for an amulet was just too much to comprehend.",
	"Poison washes over you!",
	"A feeling of benevolence washes over you, but you don't actually feel better!",
	"Suddenly your surroundings change.",
	"You hear squeaking noises. (At least it's not air current noises instead.)",

	"You feel that the girls and women are getting ready to use their sexy butts as weapons.",
	"You long for beautiful sexy women with tender butt cheeks and lovely high heels.",
	"You feel that you'll want to use the toilet more often. Also, somehow your physique seems weaker now...",
	"You feel that you angered the womanhood. If you now hit a woman, you will be hit with retribution!",
	"You just know that your legs are going to be ripped open by very sharp-edged combat boot heels.",
	"If you ever stand still for too long, a bunch of bloodthirsty female painted toenails is going to hurt your beautiful skin, so make sure you keep moving!",
	"Lots of shreds of skin will be scraped off your shins, and the girls will enjoy it.",
	"You feel that people are building toilets for you to use.",
	"Your sexy butt signals that it wants to produce beautiful farting noises!",
	"Your nuts can expect to get kicked repeatedly by all the girls and women now!",

	"You sense the death of a pure, innocent being.",
	"Nadja is really angry about the fact that you tried to hit her, and uses a pair of buckled shoes to scratch up and down your legs, ripping a lot of skin to shreds.",
	"Nadja notices that you're bleeding, which seems to make her even more angry as she continues slitting your legs full length with the metal buckle!",
	"You are severely hurt, but Nadja just doesn't want to stop punishing you with her very female buckled shoes. She continues destroying your unprotected skin and announces that if you hit her one more time, she will kill you.",
	"Please press the sweet, candy-like button!",
	"The beguiling stench emanating from your pink sneakers fills the area...",
	"Nad yes flax!",
	"You've forgotten who you are, but you are back.",

	"The watchmen in Nethack Fourk have stupid weird-ass names like 'Schtulman'. Seriously???",
	"Unnethack implemented a very evil patch idea where erosion can nuke your cloak of magic resistance. Granted, here in SLEX that can happen too, but at least I made it so that erosionproofing an armor piece is not such an unholy pain in the butt!",
	"SOMEONE (probably Satan) made it so that instead of two early-game trophies, Satanhack-based variants only have one for Junethack. Nethack Fourk then tried to make a mines end trophy... except that it does not work, I really wonder why couldn't Nethack4 and its descendants just keep the (WORKING!!!) vanilla 3.4.3 code?",
	"In Nethack Fourk, you actually cannot push boulders while hallucinating, which is some A-grade bullshit. Makes you wonder whether the developer planned to screw up that badly...",
	"You have mail from user 'AmyBSOD'. It reads: 'Currently I'm playing the worst nethack fork of all, Fourk, which I hereby decide to name Screwhack.'",
	"If you decide to play Nethack Fourk, well, if you lose alignment record, you might as well commit sudoku or hari kari because you can't get alignment from killing monsters and will thus be unable to do the quest.",
	"Don't play evil Nethack variants - you will die in screwhack because SOMEONE made it so that zapping a monster with tele does no longer work on a no-teleport level. Fuck this shit. SLASH'EM Extended certainly won't implement no bullshit wand destruction patches except maybe as a joke mode.",
	"Someone trashed the samurai in Nethack Fourk on purpose, because said someone never plays the samurai himself and therefore never noticed how godawfully weak they've become.",
	"When I (Amy) told my roommate about my death in Nethack Fourk during 2017's Junethack, she said that FIQ and jonadab shall forever be cursed.",
	"There is something completely retarded called wand 'balance' patch (should be renamed to wand destruction patch). Words can't even begin to describe that crap.",
	"The wand balance patch is apparently based on an essay written by SATAN, and the variant developers who implemented it are his vrock and balrog minions.",
	"Konnichi wa Erotic Thai Bitch, welcome to FIQHack! You are a lawful female human Samurai. The game will crash whenever you fumble around with your bag of holding because the nethack4 system is teh crash0r.",
	"In FIQhack, meleeing zombies or just standing next to them will zombify you without any specific message. Apparently they can passively spread airborne contagions or something.",
	"If a mordor orc reads stinking cloud in FIQhack's Minetown, the watch captain will become hostile to YOU, and kill you.",
	"All the stupid satanic nethack4 variants make it so that entering a new dungeon level gives turns for all the monsters on it, which was not the case in vanilla and can be deadly depending on what the monsters are.",
	"Dynahack inexplicably allows demon lords and princes to wake up spontaneously, and only God knows why. At least there's no guaranteed Demogorgon lair though!",
	"The save file is corrupted... The gamestate or save file is internally inconsistent. However, the game can be recovered from a backup, and then Nethack4 will crash again in exactly the same place. Genius.",
	"You hear a joshu pronouncing the formula on a scroll of genocide! Wiped out all samurai. Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?",
	"FIQ should just accept the fact that letting monsters use all items in the game is a stupid idea! He should cut his losses and make a sane variant instead, where they don't randomly read genocide and wipe you out!",
	"In FIQhack you can name your character 'Erotic Thai Bitch', but certain other satanhack-based variants don't allow it because the 'genius' developers implemented sloppy fixes just to taunt the players. FIQhack confirmed better than Nethack4.",
	"The RNG decides to send in reinforcements to punish people who kill innocent monsters.",
	"Did you know that the elder priest in dnethack is an absolute MOTHER FUCKER? No single monster should be that strong, not even close, especially if it's a mandatory fight.",
	"Did you know that the elder priest in dnethack is an absolute MOTHER FUCKER? Chris must really hate all living beings because holy HELL is that thing's attack unbalanced or what. And there is zero defense against it.",
	"Did you know that the elder priest in dnethack is an absolute MOTHER FUCKER? As if the asshole tentacle attack isn't bad enough, he gave it a flag that gives it ZERO SPELLCASTING COOLDOWN TIME IN A VARIANT WHERE MONSTER SPELLCASTING IS ALREADY OVERPOWERED AS HECK.",
	"Did you know that the elder priest in dnethack is an absolute MOTHER FUCKER? Whoever invented that asshole tentacle attack should have its own real-life tentacle removed in a most painful way.",
	"Do not play dnethack. You will make it to the sanctum and basically step on everything along the way, except for Dagon (who is really unbalanced), but the real showstopper comes when you try to claim the amulet and find out the monster holding it has a 'fook you player, game over, all your equipment, stats and everything are suddenly meaningless, you die thank you come again' attack.",
	"Did you know that dnethack is the best variant if you don't consider slex? It has high heels!!!",
	"Did you know that there are high heels in dnethack too? Shame Chris didn't add a possibility to use the stiletto heels to sever the asshole elder priest's asshole tentacles and stomp them to a bloody pulp.",
	"Wanna know what it means when the elder priest tentacles to tentacle you? It means that you just pushed AmyBSOD's berserk button. RAAAAAAAAAAAH! RAGE!",

	"Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis.",
	"Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be like ambition.",
	"I'd rather be rich than stupid.",
	"We tend to scoff at the beliefs of the ancients. But we can't scoff at them personally, to their faces, and this is what annoys me.",
	"Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.",
	"As the evening sky faded from a salmon color to a sort of flint gray, I thought back to the salmon I caught that morning, and how gray he was, and how I named him Flint.",

	"I bet it was pretty hard to pick up girls if you had the Black Death.",
	"It's fascinating to think that all around us there's an invisible world we can't even see. I'm speaking, of course, of the World of the Invisible Scary Skeletons.",
	"Whenever I hear the sparrow chirping, watch the woodpecker chirp, catch a chirping trout, or listen to the sad howl of the chirp rat, I think: Oh boy! I'm going insane again.",
	"He was the kind of man who was not ashamed to show affection. I guess that's what I hated about him.",
	"The next time I have meat and mashed potatoes, I think I'll put a very large blob of potatoes on my plate with just a little piece of meat.",

	"Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead. No, wait, not me, you.",
	"If you ever catch on fire, try to avoid looking in a mirror, because I bet that will really throw you into a panic.",

	"Consider the daffodil. And while you're doing that, I'll be over here, looking through your stuff.",
	"I think my new thing will be to try to be a real happy guy. I'll just walk around being real happy until some jerk says something stupid to me.",
	"I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs in my brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea but it's just eggs hatching.",
	"Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good books.",
	"What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds singing and the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want to get drunk?",
	"Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like a regular window.",
	"If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people, like I am now.",
	"Most of the time it was probably real bad being stuck down in a dungeon. But some days, when there was a bad storm outside, you'd look out your little window and think, 'Boy, I'm glad I'm not out in that.'",
	"I hope that after I die, people will say of me: 'That guy sure owed me a lot of money.'",
	"The tired and thirsty prospector threw himself down at the edge of the watering hole and started to drink. But then he looked around and saw skulls and bones everywhere. 'Uh-oh,' he thought. 'This watering hole is reserved for skeletons.'",

	"I wonder if angels believe in ghosts.",
	"I don't understand people who say life is a mystery, because what is it they want to know?",
	"I think people tend to forget that trees are living creatures. They're sort of like dogs. Huge, quiet, motionless dogs, with bark instead of fur.",
	"Sometimes I think the world has gone completely mad. And then I think, 'Aw, who cares?' And then I think, 'Hey, what's for supper?'",
	"If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is 'God is crying'. And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is 'Probably because of something you did'.",
	"Contrary to popular belief, the most dangerous animal is not the lion or tiger or even the elephant. The most dangerous animal is a shark riding on an elephant, just trampling and eating everything they see.",

	"To me, truth is not some vague, foggy notion. Truth is real. And, at the same unreal. Fiction and fact and everything in-between, plus some things I can't remember, all rolled into one big 'thing'. This is truth, to me.",
	"If you're ever stuck in some thick undergrowth, in your underwear, don't stop and start thinking of what other words have 'under' in them, because that's probably the first sign of jungle madness.",

Yes, beholders are supposed to be warning level 2, after all there's no official rule that monsters with instadeath attacks absolutely have to be warning level 5 and if you know that beholders are low-level, what you as a player are expected to do is to be paranoid about warning level 2's.",
	"If you can't beat the original Grunthack where beholders are warning level 2, and have to artificially boost their level so they don't appear before you're 'ready' for them, you're not really beating Grunthack - you're cheating past its difficulty because you're too bad a player to handle the version that SGrunt developed. (No offense intended to those who actually managed to beat Grunthack 0.21, which is quite the feat indeed.)",
	"Sadly, the speedhack bug in Nethack Fourk was fixed instead of being turned into an optional challenge. The way it worked was so that your movement energy per turn would start at a rather high value and decrease to a point where monsters got 12 turns for every turn of yours, and then you'd get several moves per turn again. Would be interesting to figure out a strategy to use your high-speed turns for stuff you couldn't otherwise pull off and then find a way to make sure you don't get killed during the low-speed turns, but of course Jonadab will never put it back into the game. :(",
	"The allegedly 'superior' Nethack4 save system is in fact very inferior to the 3.4.3 one, because Satan decided to make the game crash when impossible() is called. And woe to you if you actually get a segfault, since there is no automatic recovery and you have to annoy the server administrator and hope he restores your game. Some (thankfully not all) server administrators then even refuse to care about the games they host and won't restore the crashed saves unless they already had their latte macchiato on that day!",
	"In Junethack 2017, some players were 'botting' (really they were using macros) and then the tournament administrator decided to ban all games that lasted for less than 10 seconds. Great, that way quite a bunch of perfectly valid games I played were discarded, and as a result those order of the cockatrice hardcore autists ended with more unique deaths than we of Team Dislexiapater had, because at least 30 of my unique deaths simply got erased. What am I supposed to do, wank off for 10 seconds after starting a game? (Mister Float Eyeler told me that he doesn't expect me to be capable of wanking off within 10 seconds when I said that...)",
	"Because while the vanilla version might be shit or get boring quickly (see: angband, nethack, etc) thanks to the magic of open source you can make your own variant where enemies throw mana storms at you and hit you with soft shoes in a dungeon 200 times bigger than intended.",

	"pseudoamyposchengband: The one with the mana stormers in town and the foot fetish girl monsters? I swear to god, everything that woman touches turns into a steaming heap of shit.",
	"What? You're mentioning the name Amy and the term 'foot fetish' in the same sentence? But Amy doesn't have a foot fetish, she just likes high heels is all!",
	"do you want to play as A. a rogue who kills his foes with daggers or B. a jedi who shoots the place up with an assault rifle? if your answer was 'C. a pony transvestite kicking enemies to death with high heeled shoes' then play slex",
	"Infinitely multiplying spellbooks fountain out from the pile, filling the room!  As you are crushed under the pressure of the books, you hear the dungeon starting to collapse.  Do you want your possessions identified?",
	"A grue is a fictional predatory monster that dwells in the dark. The word was first used as a fictional predator in Jack Vance's Dying Earth universe (described as being part 'ocular bat', part 'unusual hoon', and part man).", 
	"Chris says 'Players will say bad words if you make them drop their equipment.' Well, players will say even worse words if he makes them lose their equipment forever by creating a certain elder priest and giving him outerspace melee abilities.",
	"Whoa, apparently Elona has a gigantic loophole where monsters with ranged attacks will not fire unless their distance is 5 squares or less, so you can cheese some of the most powerful foes very easily if you can outspeed them and keep the distance, because you can fire at them while they're standing 7 squares away. Did the developers PLAN to screw up like that???",
	"Looking in the water (when you live inside a building) is stupid.",
	"Whenever you split a pudding in Nethack Fourk, you always get a blood pudding without fail, and it will 0wn you. So you have to go out of your way if you want to kill a black/brown pudding without getting your butt kicked.",
	"In Nethack Fourk, blood puddings are generated as a punishment for completely normal gameplay. I mean, you're a samurai and your main weapon happens to be edged. What is the developer expecting? That you pick up a quarterstaff that weighs 200 units and burdens you, and pound the black pudding to death with that?",
	"Did you know that ais523 is literally Satan? So far, I always thought his nethack4 variant didn't mess with gameplay stuff. But somehow he snuck in the evil patch idea to make disintegration resistance not protect your gear, meaning the resistance is completely worthless now. Can you believe it???",
	"Apparently, the fact that disintegration resistance rightfully protects your gear in vanilla nethack is supposed to be a bug. I say the fact that it doesn't protect your gear in nethack4 is the real bug, because seriously. Losing your cloak of magic resistance means you might as well suicide!",
	"Sporkhack has some god damn shitty mother fucker destroy armor spellcasters that will FUCKING UNEROSIONPROOF YOUR GEAR WITHOUT FAIL, meaning all that work you put into fooproofing that cloak of magic resistance (removing everything else because people are too lazy to allow the scroll of enchant armor to be targetted by the player, confusing yourself somehow which is difficult to do before turn 20000, and then reading enchant armor) was for naught. GENIUS!!!",
	"The kicker to Sporkhack's incredibly unbalanced destroy armor monster spell? magic resistance doesn't prevent your stuff from being destroy armored! it just takes one or two more casts for the monster! plus you can't genocide Rodney and he can cast it too and has some insanely buffed stats in spork, and you can only recharge the wand of death once :P",
	"In Nethack4, disintegration resistance does jack diddly. Losing your equipment is the big deal, the thing you're desperately trying to prevent by getting the resistance, and that does no longer work. If you let the rays hit you often enough that you receive one while not wearing anything, you deserve to be dead anyway, but no one who obtains the resistance would be foolish enough to run around without armor.",
	"At first, the creator of Nethack4 might seem to be a true genius, making a variant that just changes the interface and does some very minor QoL things like giving candles to gnomes or allowing you to BUC-test stuff inside a container by dropping the container on an altar. But then you get disintegration resistance and think, 'hey I can ditch the amulet of reflection and wear life saving now!' And then the black dragon breathes on you and your cloak of magic resistance is disintegrated despite the resistance. CURSE SATAN!",
	"It's incredible that I (Amy) even managed to ascend Nethack4 in the first place, considering disintegration resistance does no longer work and might just as well be removed from the game entirely. Yes, you won't die from the second breath after the first one nuked irreplacable parts of your ascension kit. But that doesn't matter, since you won't find another cloak of magic resistance and will thus resolve to point that wand of death in . direction to end the agony and then play a good variant (read: SLASH'EM Extended) instead.",
	"Apparently, Nethack4 had a different developer at some point, meaning that not everything was done by ais523. And apparently that other developer is the true devil because he/she/it/xir/(insert gender-appropriate pronoun here) hates disintegration resistance with a fiery passion and thereby decided to trash it to hell and beyond. I state, only an evil variant that implements evil patch ideas would do such a thing.",
	"The type of ice block (Soviet5lo) somehow made the wild assertion that I (Amy) didn't know the difference between rnz and rn1. Of course I know the difference, I changed most random calls to rnz because I fucking LIKE rnz! Yes, technique timeouts are supposed to be very random, this is working as intended and not a programming error!",
	"Actually, it could be summed up as, Soviet5lo seems to not realize that when I change things in slex, I do so because I want the effects of those changes in the game. He just goes 'it makes no sense, REVERTREVERTREVERT IT IN SLASHTHEM!!!!!!!!!11111'",
	"You vaguely feel a vague sense of vagueness.",
	"Monsters being able to use scrolls of genocide was never intended, will never be balanced, and yet will never disappear from FIQhack.",
	"Nethack Fourk does the very weird thing of streamlining the game by making many things guaranteed or restricting the available results for the RNG, which makes for a very boring game IMHO. Here in the land of SLEX, rn2 and rnz calls abound, and if the game makes a full-screen terror hall filled to the brim with random U then you gotta cope with it or die, bitch!",
	"Yes, I implemented dnethack's elder priest in slex and made him much more evil. He has data delete, ragnarok, bisection and decapitation attacks, and some of the tentacle attacks are more powerful than they are in dnethack. But slex is still less evil because the elder priest is completely optional in slex! Ha!",
	"If you don't kill Vecna, he will spawn in one of the Yendorian Tower subdungeons and be a heck of a lot stronger. Don't say I didn't warn you when he ends the life of your otherwise perfectly ascendable character.",
	"The Illusory Castle is an ever-confusing place!",
	"Have fun with the Void and its neverending stream of OOD ghosts!",
	"You absolutely want to wear the Boots of the Machine, which is an artifact pair of speed boots, because they have the wonderful aggravate monster property that you always wanted!",
	"There are people who seriously assert that dnethack is more balanced than slex. HA HA HA, good joke. dnethack's 'balance' consists of 'hey let's add more artifacts and don't care at all whether they are balanced, and add 200 cannon fodder monster types that you can simply steamroller and 10 ultra overpowered monsters that will wreck your shit no matter how good your gear is'.",
	"Yes, SLEX is well balanced. Just because it has monsters that will kill you if you're foolish enough to engage them doesn't make it unbalanced. In fact, just because you died doesn't mean the game is shit or unbalanced, it just means that your playing skill is probably rather low and you need to train more.",
	"Always remember that SLASH'EM Extended isn't shit. If you want to curse at the game, consider cursing at your lack of playing skill instead, because that's probably what killed you.",
	"Do you like it if the messages in the game mock you directly?",
	"Do you want to slap me (AmyBSOD) for being such an annoying bitch that puts tons of mocking messages into the game?",
	"If you're fed up with this game, clearly what you should do is to go on reddit or IRC or nethackwiki or whatever, and write a long, convoluted rant about all the things you think are shit, culminating in a tirade of curses like 'omg Amy how can you be so stupid and make such a shitty game?'.",
	"No, I don't do drugs when designing SLEX. I'm just capable of being high even without such stuff. :P",
	"Yes, you are right when you say that only an insane person can make SLEX. And I'm fucking proud of it, because otherwise SLEX wouldn't exist, or at least it wouldn't be what it is now.",
	"I (Amy) don't need help. In fact, if a psychologist reprogrammed me, I might end up doing the unthinkable thing and revertrevertrevert all the changes I did to the game and we'd end up with a second SLASHTHEM, i.e. a very booooooooring game that would make any player cry tears of blood after 5 minutes of playing.",
	"It's impossible to play SLASHTHEM for more than 5 minutes without getting bored to tears. All the things that make SLEX good are missing from it, and you'd better play regular SLASH'EM instead of SLASHTHEM because otherwise you're constantly reminded of what things could be like, because some of the SLEX stuff is still in there but mostly devoid of the functionality it has in SLEX.",
	"If you are reading this message, you missed the opportunity to ascend SLEX while the main dungeon was still only 72 levels long. Now it's much longer, and to top it off, you have to traverse a very long bonus dungeon after getting the Amulet of Yendor.",
	"The Amy has ascended a 4-conduct cavewoman in this game. Seriously, SLEX isn't nearly as unwinnable as it seems, although it's certainly also not nearly as easy as I'm making it sound right now.",
	"Don't skip past messages with ESC! Doing so will eventually get you killed. I've seen a slex player die that way after he had already claimed the Amulet of Yendor.",
	"In SLEX, you're never invincible. Don't let your guard down, ever, no matter how overpowered your gear might seem to be. There's always things that can kill you, things that can ruin your items, things that can steal your intrinsics, and more.",
	"It's a damn shame that Soviet5lo is not the kind of developer that ignores 'moral codes' and 'conventions' like I (Amy) do. Instead, in SLASHTHEM he removed every SLEX feature that could even vaguely be considered offensive by someone. Actually, going by that logic he'd have to remove a lot more than he did, because for every X there's always someone who will find X offensive. I, on the other hand, decided that I just don't care and the transvestite role will stay in SLEX, bitches.",
	"Yes, I (Amy) don't give a fuck. I put into slex whatever I want, when I want it. I only give in to player complaints if they are legitimate, i.e. stuff like 'hey, the wiki says this role gets technique X, but I didn't get it!' or other real bugs. But if you whine around like this: 'damn you amy i triggered a yellow spell trap and it took 2000 turns of waiting for it to time out and then i triggered it again REMOVE IT FROM THE GAME', then I say 'nope, it works as intended, good luck with your run' :P",
	"The fact that Soviet5lo always says 'this makes no sense' when referring to anything I changed in slex, makes no sense itself. Because if he had actually talked to me about the changes in question, I'd have explained to him why I made them. (No guarantee that he wouldn't still think they made no sense, of course.)",
	"Yes, I make changes to the game's code because I want the effect of those changes in the game. It's not my fault if Soviet5lo comes along and says 'this makes no sense' about 80%% of my changes just because he is too narrow-minded to grasp the reason for why I made those particular changes.",
	"Apparently Soviet5lo, the type of ice block that created the abomination known as SLASHTHEM, does not understand my programming philosophy one bit. If I don't scatter explanative comments all around the SLEX source code, he makes wild assertions like 'hmm apparently Amy doesn't know the difference between rn1 and rnz' or 'hmm she moved the monster respawn timer code to a struct u variable, this makes no sense' and then reverts it. Yes, in the latter case he reverted a bugfix because he apparently didn't really read the code and just assumed that because I wrote it, it must be bad.",
	"Well FWIW I need the wand destruction patch as much as a hole in the head. What's it good for? The only thing it really accomplishes is that the only role that matters (samurai) is suddenly very bad at using wands.",
	"Damn the WAND DESTRUCTION PATCH. Damn it to hell. That thing is such an evil motherfucker and shall die in a fire.",
	"There would theoretically be a way to turn the wand destruction patch into something good (e.g. a wand balance patch), but currently the thing calls itself wand 'balance' patch while in reality it trashes wands to hell AND makes it so that you can never have them out in open inventory again in Nethack Fourk. And yes, the samurai is the only role that matters in that variant.",
	"The samurai is the only role that matters in Nethack Fourk, but the day will come when that can no longer be selected unless you waste countless hours of your precious life playing a barbarian. Mark my words.",
	"In order to not be bullshit, the wand destruction patch would require a total overhaul. Most important parts would include no item destruction if you reflect and something has an elemental attack wand, wands of teleportation work again when zapped at monsters regardless of skill level, and wands of death instakill susceptible monsters again regardless of skill level.

If that is still too many for your taste, enable the quick_autosave option, which will autosave your game once every 19 turns. Yes, they're prime numbers for a reason.",
	"Are you getting lots of segfaults or other random crashes? That shouldn't be the case, but if it somehow is, you should do two things: 1. notify me (Amy), preferably with information as to what might be causing the errors, and 2. turn on the quick_autosave option which causes the game to autosave more often so in the case of a crash you don't lose a lot of progress.",
	"NetHack and its variants are written in the C programming language, which unfortunately allows functions to try to access freed or uninitialized variables. That can cause a segfault and crash the game. If that happens, tell the dev team about it, including any information that might allow the developers to track down how the crash is caused!",
	"Crash bugs are there to be fixed. If your game crashes, tell me (Amy) and give as much information as you can. I strive to make SLEX as crash-free as I can, and whatever crash bug you encounter, I'll want to remove it from the game.",
	"If you get the message 'Oops... Suddenly, the dungeon collapses.', it means that the game has encountered a panic. Contrary to popular belief your savegame is NOT gone forever, or at least in about 9 of 10 cases it will make a panic save that can be recovered. Look for it in your savegame folder, or if playing on a public server, ask the administrator to look for a file with the .e extension. Removing that extension will allow the game to be loaded again, but make a backup of it just to be on the safe side!",
	"Occasionally, when a new level is being loaded, SLEX might appear to hang. This is especially true when playing in ironman mode (it can even happen upon trying to start a new ironman character). Be patient, don't kill the window right away. Some monster spawn routines may take up to a few minutes to complete. Watch some youtube videos or otherwise kill time until the game has finished loading the level.",
