Incomplete changelog for SLASH'EM Extended, written by Amy, given in reverse chronological order

2.0.9
- Added anoter possible negative effect to fountain quaffing.
- A player standing on a crystal water tile was able to quaff from it, which was not intended. Fixed.
- Hostile werecreatures have a chance of summoning more monsters in a single summon.
- Fixed an oversight that prevented switching from wizard to explore mode more than once.
- The zombieman has a much lower chance of starting with the stronger energy gun ammos, which is supposed to make the doomed barracks special room less deadly for a low-level player.
- Changed monster population formula for special rooms, which should randomize their "filled-ness" more than before. Also toned down the amount of monsters in certain types of rooms, especially the otherwise far too dangerous void room.
- Pseudo objects, used for e.g. hallucination and spellcasting, can no longer be artifacts, and if they become fake artifacts they won't increase the fake artifact counter.
- Fixed an error introduced by an earlier commit which made it possible to tame any domestic monster with any type of food.
- If a pet is leashed or the player has recently used a tin whistle, the "tracking code" will be disabled. This makes the pet follow more closely, but can cause it to get stuck in a U-turn.
- Changed regions in some special levels, which enables them to be filled with monsters in ironman mode. This causes a few issues on certain levels, most prominently a "Cannot place branch!" error; the way the game originally handled this was very stupid, because it entered an infinite loop. 0/10, vanilla devteam. Sorry. Anyway, I changed it so it simply forces the branch to be placed anyway, and since this can cause magic portals to appear in a wall, I added extra code to transform the terrain underneath a generated magic portal to a walkable one (water still counts as walkable, so ad aquarium vaults should work like they used to).
- Migohives now have a chance of spawning a wider variety of migos, including the "gomi" monsters from dnethack.
- Monsters that use the MS_BONES sound, e.g. skeletons, can now rattle while near the player. Unless the player makes a saving throw based on magic cancellation, this will cause 2 turns of paralysis.
- Fixed a bug where "hmnen" levels could never be generated due to a typo.
- If a rooms-and-corridors level is generated in Gehennom, there is a higher than usual chance of it containing special rooms.
- The Gehennom trophy can only be gotten by entering through the front entrance, which is the downstair on the Valley of the Dead.
- If you die with 0 points, the game will call you a noob.
- Fixed a bug where it was impossible to pick up an object on a crystal water tile. Also, it should no longer be possible to dip items into crystal water that you shouldn't be able to reach.
- Levitator race player characters will pick up an entire stack of objects now if they use one of their tools or the telekinesis techniques.
- The nopet option is ignored if the player uses the Kurwa role; they will start with a pet regardless of the option setting now.
- Monsters in doomed barracks generate with less ammo.
- The water bolt spell is now level 6 instead of 1, considering how powerful it is.
- Tried again to fix the bug where tools being destroyed on use (e.g. unicorn horns randomly vanishing, but also the vanilla behavior of cursed crystal balls exploding) could produce a segfault because somehow arti_speaks was called even though it should not. However, I fear the bug may still exist...
- Added GM mode (Game Master mode), which is turned on with the OPTIONS=gmmode line in the options file. It allows me (Amy) to send mail to the player to spawn monsters. Also added a gmmessage option that defaults to on; if turned off, the player will not be told which monsters I'm spawning.
- Fixed the bug where once the player's Vorpal Blade decapitates a monster, it could then be thrown to automatically decapitate monsters as long as no further melee attacks are used.

2.0.8
- Fixed a panic bug when trying to light a stack of cursed torches (bug present in SLASH'EM too).

2.0.7
- Fixed the long-standing bug where hallucinated appearances for tools would cause obj_is_local segfault panics (corrupting the savegame beyond repair) when the temporary hallucinated tool was a container that contained a timed object (e.g. an egg). This bug exists in SLASH'EM too.
- Added missing descriptions for some new monster traits that were added in previous versions.
- Shoplifting can increase the cop wanted level by an amount relative to how much the stolen merchandise cost.
- Fixed a segfault when eating a tin of black hole blob.
- Crystal water uses the correct glyph in DECgraphics mode now.
- Ctrl-P at a prompt really doesn't work while under certain nasty trap effects (it used to be possible to circumvent those trap effects to a certain degree!).
- Unicorn horns fix status effects first, and only if there are none that can be fixed, it will try to fix lost attribute points.
- Bundle monsters should have specific melee attack messages, but I found out they aren't being displayed since the attack types don't match. Maybe I'll add them later.
- Switched to a different method of determining the message on a t-shirt, making them truly random. This is done by adding an extra variable to items, hence the savebreak. Any item that gets generated will have this variable set to a random number, but for now it's only relevant for shirts.

2.0.6
- Hanging up at a pending instadeath but before the game actually declares the player dead will instakill the player upon restoring.
- The #explore command can be used in wizard mode to switch to explore mode.
- Angel race characters with negative alignment record have aggravate monster.

2.0.5
- Fixed the "drop 0 gold pieces" segfault.
- Pets whose base level is 50 or higher, as well as those generated by jonadab's random monster perlscript, have an increased chance of turning traitor. Also, pets that turn traitor can now be frenzied sometimes.
- Fixed a bug where the addition of new terrain types caused certain interface screw traps to no longer work correctly.
- Fixed a bug where decontamination was too easy.
- Allow players wearing ski heels or certain artifacts to walk on snow more quickly.
- Dipping the book of the dead in lava doesn't erroneously say "the book burns up" when it really doesn't.
- Shoplifting or having a high sin counter can give a cop wanted level, which repeatedly causes kops to respawn for a while.
- Firing a bow, crossbow or sling at point blank is ineffective and does less damage than it would if the monster were standing farther away.
- Pets eating corpses or non-comestible food gain less nutrition than previously.
- Attacking a monster with the flickerer egotype using something that does no damage gives better messages, since players used to not realize they were doing no damage.
- Ranged weapons were nerfed in a number of ways, including a lowered chance to hit if the target is standing far away, a reduction of the damage bonuses given to the individual ammos, and allowing certain monsters (most notably ghosts, but also amorphous ones) to avoid projectiles with a certain chance. Firearms are exempt from most of those nerfs.
- When the player is on Fort Ludios, the dungeon depth is displayed.
- Certain actions that summon kops will now spawn kop cubes too.
- Dipping spellbooks into lava will burn them away completely.
- Finished functionality for the new special rooms and terrain types.

2.0.4
- Improved the handling of the obj_is_local error. The underlying cause was not found, but the odds of producing a corrupted savegame should be lower now.
- Added many new terrain types, dungeon features and special rooms that can be randomly generated over the course of the game.
- Better display of the gamemode string in the xlogfile entry.
- The message suppression trap suppresses any and all --More-- prompts as well.
- The previous message command cannot be used to "cheat" past certain interface screw trap effects.
- The #overview command does not work at all while the display loss trap is in effect.
- Stairdancing is limited: now, there's a chance that the player cannot use staircases for a couple of turns after taking one, forcing them to fight whichever monsters they were trying to cheese. Magic portals are also affected for the same reason.
- Monster-versus-monster calming attacks are no longer guaranteed to calm the defending monster.

2.0.3
- Fixed an error in the handling of the obj_is_local crash where the game would fail to save data to the savegame, corrupting it in the process.
- The summon undead spell no longer produces tame undead, and the command undead spell can sometimes create traps on the current dungeon level as a negative side effect, plus monsters are more resistant to the effect and can occasionally be frenzied instead.
- Items can be dipped into lava.
- Slightly improved player's melee to-hit rating, nerfed ranged weapon to-hit rating to be closer to the new melee values, and there's a 5% chance of a monster's AC being halved for any particular AC check, making them a little bit easier to hit (AC -30 monsters should not be completely impossible to hit unless you have uber items and stats).
- Contamination effects on HP/Pw regeneration depend on how contaminated you are.
- Added a couple of monster attacks, and the contamination effect that works similar to weeping angels from dnethack: it gradually saps the player's wisdom in a way that cannot be restored.

2.0.2
- Added a STUPIDRANDOMMONSTERBUG compile flag that is not defined by default, but can be turned on in case seemingly random things (e.g. monsters hitting with a poisoned attack) are causing the game to crash (seems to happen on certain Unices). It should *only* be turned on if those crashes are actually happening, since it turns off the randomized names of certain monsters.
- Tried to fix the scroll of copying segfault that happens on public servers, not sure if it works now.
- Monsters associated with brains can give +INT when eaten.
- Protection from shape changers works better and should not make 50% of all werefoo unkillable anymore.
- Monsters with M2_DOMESTIC or M3_PETTY flags are tameable, even if they'd otherwise be resistant to taming (e.g. due to being in the @ monster class).
- Increased the prices for certain magical types of shields.
- Angering the watchmen in town levels summons Keystone Kops.
- The "lag defense tower" monster causes artificial lag.
- Monsters with ranged attacks will not breathe while the player is in a wall, and if they fire a projectile it can now hit the player instead of stopping on the empty square in front of the wall.
- Chest and door traps can sometimes surround the player with more traps.
- Turning off the sparkle option no longer disables the lag trap's artificial lag effect.
- Overhauled the shop maze level by making sure all the shops can be reached without teleportation or digging.
- Cursed invocation tools still have a chance of working correctly on the vibrating square.
- Stoning and sliming should always give a message when they start.
- Hallucination provides 90% chance of not turning to stone when the player otherwise would.
- Fixed a bug where bumping into a door while under the hyperbluewall trap effect didn't damage the player.
- Scrolls, potions and spellbooks can train the device skill, and the latter benefit from it as well.
- Fixed a bug where monsters with litter gazes could affect the player even while not seen.
- Controlled lycanthropy prompts require a full yes/no answer.
- Using #technique while on the vibrating square gives a special message. This is meant as a way to find the vibrating square while under the effect of multiple interface screw trap effects, which is not all that likely but in the case that it does happen, the game should not be unwinnable by insanity.
- Certain traps that were supposed to be always visible were not. Fixed.
- Prevent an infinite loop if the game tries to spawn a monster on a level filled completely with monsters, by having it abort and print an error message if no suitable position was found after 100000 tries.
- Occasionally, newly spawned monsters might be in the player's field of view now even if positions outside of the player's LOS were available.
- Circumvent monsndx panic error by having the game default to spawning a PM_HUMAN.

2.0.1
- Set the default value for the popup_dialog option to true.
- Set the default interface to tty if both tty and curses are available.
- Fake artifacts are resistant to bad polymorphs and nymphs' item-stealing attacks.
- Armors with enchantment properties will not be deleted if they are a part of a monster's starting inventory and the monster is killed.
- Cancelled gremlins once again cannot steal intrinsics from the player.
- Increased the spawn chances for the different types of candles, and placed a bunch of various candles on Vlad's tower.
- Fixed the bug where the mail daemon would deliver gold pieces for minimalist race players.
- While standing on a pit but not actually trapped in it, the > key allows the player to descend into the pit.
- Quitting or escaping the dungeon early on prevents the game from getting on the high-score list.
- Quaffing lethe water now causes amnesia.
- Increased the starting HP for the erdrick role.
- Rodney's tower and the fake towers now spawn with random special rooms.
- Fungus farms and lemure pits spawn a wider range of monster types.
- Artifacts (both real and fake) never resist identification attempts, and are never deleted when they were in a monster's starting inventory. If a weapon or armor is randomly generated with a nonzero enchantment value, there's a significant chance that it gets made into a fake artifact.
- Implemented the #annotate and #overview commands.
- Using : while standing on a throne or altar tells the player how to interact with these dungeon features.
- Lightsabers can #force in > direction while lit to dig a hole.
- If the player is polymorphed into or riding a very fast (speed > 24) monster, their actual movement speed will be lower than the monster's nominal speed, depending on the polymorphing/riding skill.
- Dipping an item into a toilet can cause the toilet to break.
- The prompt when a nymph tries to steal a cursed item requires a yes/no answer.
- Failed wishes (usually when the player's luck is negative) can have a variety of nasty effects.
- The cmdassist message tells the player how to switch between vikeys and number pad.
- If the player reads a scroll of symmetry, the quicktravel command is deactivated.
- Changed generation chances for certain weapons, most notably making firearms and their ammo more common, and long swords are no longer more common than short swords.
- Fix the segfault caused by cutting a long worm in two when it only had 1 HP or long worms were genocided.
- Items whose weight is specified as zero in objects.c weigh 16 times less (they used to weigh a half weight unit).
- Prostitutes can have sex with the player, and their maledictions can cause the dim status effect.
- Jonadab's Heavyload was incorrectly not flagged as an evil artifact.
- The god-o-meter can also work while not blessed.
- If an artifact is overenchanted and would normally evaporate, it becomes +0 instead.
- Added a bunch of dungeon level variants from GruntHack and NetHack Fourk, and harder versions of the dnethack demon lairs.

2.0.0
- A player character causing conflict will be significantly more likely to get hit by monster attacks, which has the effect of changing it from its previous "generally a boon, unless you have pets" implementation to the two-edged sword it should always have been.
- Blessed scrolls of remove curse are no longer guaranteed to uncurse everything in the player's main inventory; non-equipped items have a chance to resist. Also, full-inventory identify effects have lower odds per item to reveal stuff.
- Casting the air current spell gives a luck penalty if done in Sokoban.
- Reduced speed of the Deadly Sins to 11, and prevented them from leaving death drops to make them harder to farm in case anyone is lame enough to actually attempt that.
- Fixed an error where certain nasty traps were behaving incorrectly with the curses interface.
- Fixed a fatal error where branch staircases or magic portals could fail to be placed if the game tried to make them on a terrain type that wasn't open floor.
- Blind monsters, which were supposed to be immune to conflict, would still wander randomly (as opposed to making a beeline to the player character to attack) when a player was causing conflict. This has been corrected.
- Improved the nexus field, tunnelization, grow trees and geolysis spells.
- Fawn, satre and sticker race player characters will train the device skill more quickly than others.
- Stepping on the vibrating square will light it, and the status message will tell the player they're standing on it.
- Added a message when the player zaps a wand of inertia control.
- If the player has the petkeeping skill, it's possible to take pets along to other levels even if they're not adjacent. The higher the skill, the greater the radius. And because skills shouldn't ever have drawbacks when increased, there is a y/n prompt so the player won't have to go out of their way to ditch unwanted pets while having high skill levels.
- The sudden/unfair attack traps were doing nothing due to an oversight, which has been fixed.
- Paralysis is shown in the bottom status line.
- Blessed destroy armor scrolls prompt the player to choose the item that can be destroyed.
- Sink quaffing could cause error messages if the effect was a random potion and the game failed to make one.
- Nurse halls and beehives spawn a greater variety of monsters.
- Fixed the autoopendoors patch not interacting correctly with certain nasty traps.
- The polyinitor race has a better chance of getting a form with weapon attacks.
- Special rooms can occasionally be generated with aggravate monster rules, producing monsters that are possibly out of depth.
- Terrain-altering scrolls have lesser effects on Sokoban levels, to reduce the odds of the levels becoming nearly impossible to complete.
- Hunger level has a lesser effect on attribute training.
- Foocubus seduction has a full yes/no prompt; it was too easy to spacebar past it in the heat of combat and give an answer you didn't intend to give.
- At this point, the autoopendoors patch was implemented.
- Increased the chance of "odd" tension rooms, that is, ones where the monster selection isn't based on a specific glyph but a specific color or other random trait.
- Being zapped by a monster's wand of cancellation interrupts the player.
- The #invoke command will also suggest fake artifacts as valid choices.
- The player's summoning spells (create monster, summon undead) don't produce higher level monsters if the player has aggravate monster.
- Hostile whores have better to-hit against the player.
- Cursed lizards were abusable. Closed the loophole.
- Wishing for an object has a small chance of giving the player amnesia.
- Added a variety of warning messages in case the player is bashing with a launcher or polearm.
- Eating any mimic corpse just causes the player to mimic gold or an orange for a random time.
- Very rarely, boss monsters can be generated to "avenge" other monsters the player has killed.
- The player cannot easily uncurse their items by using pools of lethe water; they will still unbless items though.
- Fixed a ton of stuff to make the curses interface work correctly. Also added a "moreforced" option that can be disabled to turn off any predefined --More-- prompts, and made the brain-ruptured (sorry) tab confirmation in curses mode into a "tabcursesconfirm" option that defaults to off. This is because the message telling the player to press tab will not always be displayed for some reason, and we don't want players to think their game died - default behavior should always be "spacebar clears away any and all messages"!
- The curses interface was added at this point.
- Fixed the garbage strings on Unix. The flicker strip trap in particular exposed that they had huge problems.
- Fixed a bug where monsters with gaze-based item stealing attacks wouldn't check whether the player can actually see them.
- Fixed some artifacts' special attacks never triggering even though they should.
- Fixed a formatting error with erosionproof item names.
- Greatly reduced the chance of the bell of opening actually opening locked doors and iron chains, since it has many more charges now and we don't want those special effects to be too easily obtainable.
- While under the effect of a knowledge trap, the player will no longer get a confirmation when trying to step on a known trap.
- No robes will give spellcasting penalties, not even the robe of weakness.
- Added the Prostitute and Kurwa roles.

1.9.8
- A player polymorphed into a monster with spellcasting attacks has better spellcasting success chances.
- Fixed the bug where triggering a map amnesia trap wouldn't immediately refresh the screen.
- Monsters in IVAN vaults always generate with aggravate monster rules.
- Demons summoned from same-race sacrificing can be princes now, and have a very minuscule chance of being tame.
- Fixed some fallthrough bugs that caused certain characters to have the wrong starting inventory or alignment record.
- If a nymph tries to steal the player's weapon and fails, the game correctly says "weapon" now.
- Banned grid bug players and players who triggered the bishop trap from using autotravel, since it could be used to bypass the movement restrictions in certain cases.
- Fixed an off-by-one error when creating irregular rooms, which would occasionally result in such rooms being generated without walkable floor tiles and causing a panic.
- Peacevision highlights monsters with a "peaceful" green color now, as opposed to the hostile-looking orange one we had earlier.
- Beefed up skill cap drain and nastiness monster attacks by making their special effects proc more often.
- Gave scrolls of root password detection to all the new demon lords.
- If the player polymorphs one of the riders, or also if they self-polymorph for any reason, a new rider is generated somewhere on the level. This is because it's possible to get rid of them permanently by turning the polymorphed rider to stone.

1.9.7
