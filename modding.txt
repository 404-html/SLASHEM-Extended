SLASH'EM Extended is open source, and as long as you adhere to the Nethack General Public License found in the "license" file, you are free to share it with others. You are also allowed to make your own modifications to it, and publish them as long as you also make the source code available. But if you do, please give your variant a distinctive name; call it "SLASH'EM Dextered" or whatever! Because I don't want other games floating around that call themselves SLASH'EM Extended when they're not the original. So, if you make a variant, change the name so that everyone knows they're playing a variant of my variant. Thank you!

Feel free to contact me on the #em.slashem.me or #hardfought IRC channels on Freenode, my nick is usually "LarienTelrunya" but may also be "AmyBSOD" or variations thereof. Have fun, and remember, if you add interesting things to your variant, I might pull them into SLEX and give you credit :)
